                <h2>Low-Fi Paper Prototype</h2>
                <h3>SI582 Introduction to Interaction Design</h3>
                <p>When I was in Guangzhou as an undergraduate student, I volunteered at a private-owned community library called Island Library. There are hundreds of Island Libraries now in different cities of China, and those libraries are run by thousands of volunteers, who love reading and the neighborhood they live in. Sharing among libraries is a core idea of Island Libraries, but it is hard to make it real due to communication and distance obstacles. For this individual project assignment, I designed an application for library volunteers to better share their experience and resources.  </p>

Volunteers of Island Library are able to share their experience/interest via this platform and they can help other volunteers by delivering books!</p>
